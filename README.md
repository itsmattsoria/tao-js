###Tao.js
---

A javascript plugin that displays a different excerpt from the Tao Te Ching on every page load.  

No jQuery needed, just include ```tao.js``` on your site, and add an element with the id ```tao```.  

**Example**:
```
<blockquote id="tao">
    <footer>
      <cite>- Laozi -</cite>
    </footer>
  </blockquote>

```

####Todo:

* Is there a more efficient way to make a string of all of the excerpts?
