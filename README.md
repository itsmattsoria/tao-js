A javascript plugin that displays a different excerpt from the Tao Te Ching on every page load. 
No jQuery needed, just include ```tao.js``` on your site, and add an element with the id ```tao```. 
*Example:
```
<blockquote id="tao">
    <footer>
      <cite>- Laozi -</cite>
    </footer>
  </blockquote>

```
