###Tao.js

A javascript plugin that displays a different excerpt from the Tao Te Ching on every page load.  

No jQuery needed, just include ```tao.js``` in your project folder, and add it to your site:
```
<script src="js/tao.js"></script>
```
And add an element with the id ```tao```.  

**Example**:
```
<blockquote id="tao">
  <footer>
    <cite>- Laozi -</cite>
  </footer>
</blockquote>

```


That's it.

If you have suggestions or improvements, please fork and/or submit a pull request. :)

####Todo:

- Is there a more efficient way to make a string of all of the excerpts?

The excerpts were taken from the translation of the Tao Te Ching by [Stephen Mitchell](http://stephenmitchellbooks.com/translations-adaptations/tao-te-ching/), and all rights to the text belong to him. I highly recommend that you [purchase your own copy](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=tao%20te%20ching%20stephen%20mitchell&sprefix=tao+te+ching+stephen+%2Caps&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Atao%20te%20ching%20stephen%20mitchell). You'll be happy you did.
