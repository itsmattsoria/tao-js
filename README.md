####Tao.js

#####Still in production 
Todo:
* Currently using http://www.with.org/tao_te_ching_en.pdf for source, but want to switch to Stephen Mitchell translation: http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html
* Is there a more efficient way to make a string of all of the excerpts?

A javascript plugin that displays a different excerpt from the Tao Te Ching on every page load. 
No jQuery needed, just include ```tao.js``` on your site, and add an element with the id ```tao```. 
*Example:
```
<blockquote id="tao">
    <footer>
      <cite>- Laozi -</cite>
    </footer>
  </blockquote>

```
